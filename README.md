# SO-chatbot
This is a chatbot to give relevant question from stack overflow as answer to message sent via telegram app. It also supports chit chat mode to talk to you in a casual way. This was implemented using `ChatterBot` library in python. 

This is the course project of Natural Language Processing Course on Coursera by National Research University Higher School of Economics (https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing/).


The generated weights are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GV6d2-n4L6dO65n_6nrXAluG3wZRk0-h?usp=sharing). The code is in this repository. The course had 5 weeks, and the mini-projects done in Week 1 and Week 3 were used to construct this final bot.
